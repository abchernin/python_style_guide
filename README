One day I decided to be a good boy and refresh my memory on Python coding style guidelines, described in PEP 8. Plaintext is not the best option for such material, so I googled for a pdf version, but none turned up. Unwilling to leave things as they were, I formatted the original PEP's plaintext into something (for me, at least) a little more readable. Read, edit, enjoy!
